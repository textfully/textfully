              Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a

              identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited
              our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for
              example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
              within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with
              cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from
              an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
              improve site performance, and to measure the success of email
              marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
              reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies
              will impair their functioning.
